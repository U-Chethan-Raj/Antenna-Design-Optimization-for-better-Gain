# Antenna Gain Prediction and Optimization

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting and optimizing the gain of an antenna using machine learning techniques. The goal is to enhance antenna performance by analyzing key parameters such as length, width, height, frequency, substrate material, feed position, bandwidth, and directivity. The model leverages a dataset containing realistic antenna designs and their respective gains to train and validate various predictive models. The final system allows users to input antenna parameters, receive gain predictions, visualize radiation patterns, and obtain recommendations for improvement.

## Features
- **Gain Prediction**: Implements machine learning models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, Gaussian Process, and Support Vector Regression to predict antenna gain.
- **3D Visualization**: Provides graphical representations of gain distribution and radiation patterns.
- **Optimization Suggestions**: Recommends parameter adjustments to enhance antenna gain.
- **User Input Analysis**: Allows users to input antenna parameters and receive real-time feedback.
- **Ensemble Learning**: Combines multiple models to improve prediction accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, IPython Display, Warnings
- **Machine Learning Models**: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, Gaussian Process, Support Vector Regression

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes the following features:
- Length (mm)
- Width (mm)
- Height (mm)
- Frequency (GHz)
- Substrate Material (FR4/PTFE/Ceramic)
- Feed Position (Center/Edge)
- Bandwidth (MHz)
- Directivity (dB)
- Gain (dB) (Target Variable)

## Model Training and Evaluation
The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and various models are trained to predict gain. The evaluation metrics used include:
- **RÂ² Score**: Measures the proportion of variance explained by the model.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Quantifies the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.

The ensemble model aggregates predictions from individual models using weighted averaging to improve accuracy.

## Visualization
- **Actual vs. Predicted Gain**: Scatter plots showing the correlation between actual and predicted values.
- **3D Gain Visualization**: Displays antenna gain as a function of design parameters.
- **Polar Radiation Pattern**: Represents the directional gain distribution.
- **3D Directivity Pattern**: Illustrates the intensity of radiation in three dimensions.
